# Variables, Statements, and Expressions
**Variables** -- Symbolic names that act as containers for storing data values.
**Statements** -- A line of code that the interpreter executes, performing a specific action, such as assigning a value, making a decision, or executing a loop.**ex.--** x = 5,for, while 
**Expressions** -- A combination of operators and operands that is interpreted to produce some other value.**ex.--** x = 15 + 1.3

1. Integer(int) -- value is represented by int class.It contains positive or negative whole numbers. No limit for how long the integer value can be.(e.g., 42, -7)
2. Float(float): It is a real number with a floating-point representation.Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -2.5).
3. String (str):Represented by str class. Text values (e.g., 'Hello').
